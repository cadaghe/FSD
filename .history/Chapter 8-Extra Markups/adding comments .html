<p>It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time of writing it,<br /> when you come back to it later (or if someone
else needs to look at the code),comments will make it much easier to understand.</p>

<p>Although comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.</p>
